# All About Piath
I am currently a **Junior** at Mizzou with a major in **Psychology** and minor in *Black Studies*. I chose to go to Mizzou during my senior year of high school after touring the campus and loving it. I am from Kansas City, Missouri - just two hours away from Columbia. I wanted to go to a school far enough for me to be able to focus, but close enough to be able to come home anytime I needed a break. While I do love going to Mizzou, one thing I do wish I looked more into is some out of state schools. I got more into traveling after I graduated and there is definitely more to see than Missouri. I am also thinking of getting my masters degree in Industrial Psychology and getting into management or human resources. I decided to take this intro infortmation technology class because I wanted to see if I could simply just do it. I wanted to get out of my comfort zone and see if it was something I wanted to possibly get into. While this is dtill a learn as you go thing for me, I have definitely benefited a lot from taking this class and getting the exposure I wanted. I do believe life is about just getting out there and experiencing as much as you can, having fun with it, and challenging yourslef for the better. I hope you get to know more about me as you go through my website!

## All About Music and My Favorite Songs
I love music very much! I can truly say it is like therapy for me. The main genres I listen to are **rap, hip hop, afrobeats, dancehall and r&b** (with some pop music occasionally)! Whether I'm listening at a party or just when I am feeling bored, music always puts me in a better mood. I have been listening to music my whole life, however, when I was younger my older sibling were more in control and I would listen to what they would listen to. As I have grown though, I was able to find out what my likes and loves in music were and develop my own sense of what music is to me.
