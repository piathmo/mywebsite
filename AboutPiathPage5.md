#### YouTube Beauty
I cherish YouTube because of how much I was able to learn in all aspects beyond even hair & makeup. Growing up as a Black girl it was hard to find exposure for healthy hair and at one point there wasn't even makeup dark enough for some us. YouTube was able to create a community where you can always find someone who *looks like you*.
