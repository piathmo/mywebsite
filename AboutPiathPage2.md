# My Love for Kansas City
Being from Kansas City can seem lame to some, but if you're from here then you know **there is SO much to do**. From the city life in South *Kansas City* to the suburban life in North Kansas City - you will always find something to do! One interesting fact is that Kansas City is actually being developed even more with major projects such as the new soccer stadium being built right under the main Christopher S. Bond bridge that connects the city to the suburbs or even the expansion of the street car into the northside of Kansas City. It is a very diverse city with people from all around, different restaurants, bars, entertainment, music, etc. My favorite things to do in Kansas CIty is go down to Westport over the weekend, ride *Birds* along main street, walk around the Riverfront, and just explore!

#### My Favorite Restaurants
+ KC Burgers - a Somali restaurant with an amazing mix of American and Somali food, it's also family owned!
+ Texas Toms - a redtaurnt chain with various food items from tacos to burgers to seafood, a good perk is that they are open until 3AM at most of their locations
+ Trezo Mare Restaurant & Lounge - an Italian restaurant in the Northern part of Kansas City, has a very nice luxurious but home style feel inside
+ Wings Cafe - a locally owned food spot with two locations in the Kansas City are, they are known for their very detail sauce options
+ Kona Grill - a grill spot in Kansas City with the best sushi & best spicy mayo
+ Taco Express - a Mexican restaurant in South Kansas City, in my opinion, with the best tacos in Kansas City


### Sports
   ###### Kansas City has two professional sports teams - the Chiefs & The Royals

## Common Mixup
   ##### The Kansas City, Missouri & Kansas City, Kansas 
   If you're from here then you know there is a spoken rivaly between **KCMO** and **KCK**. Kansas City, Missouri was discovered *before* Kansas City, Kansas and named the famous name of "Kansas City" in 1889. KCMO started getting a lot of attention with tourists coming in and business starting to boom. KCK was then named "Kansas City" as well in order to gain more of the KCMO attraction. The funny thing is, you can actually see KCK from KCMO (and vice versa) if you're at the right spot.
