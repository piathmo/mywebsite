# Cities I Have Traveled To
I love to travel and be around a city/environment that is different than mine. Being from the Midwest, pretty much any other city is totally different. If we're going by coast, I would have to say I prefer the West Coast. There's way more scenery and a more peaceful feel to their cities. My favorite cities that I have been to would definitely have to be Vancouver, Los Angeles, South Padre Island, San Francisco, Seattle, and Chicago. I pretty much love any city with a pretty nature scene and cities with a nice skyline.

#### Vancouver

I spent an entire summer in Vancouver when I was 15. It was my first time on a plane and I was traveling alone, but that's when I discovered my love for travel. I was nervous at first, but once I understood the all airports are pretty much the same in different *fonts*, I became extra comfortable. Vancouver not only had a beautiful city skyline, but their mountain scene blew me away.

#### Los Angeles

I've been to Los Angeles (LA) a total of two times, and it was always fun! I love going to the beach and just being in the sun and enjoying the view. I feel like it is one of those places where everyone just minds their business and do what they have to do, which I love. In comparison to the Midwest, there is some sort of social standard that everyone has to meet in comparison to a big diverse city such as LA.

#### South Padre Island

My friend and I went on a trip to South Padre, which is an island off of the Texas coast. We drove there, it was a 16 hour drive but it was defintely worth it. There was so much activties and things to do for the week we were there. We got matching ear piercings, parasailed (:satisfied:), went snorkeling, horseback riding, dolphin watching, and so much more. 


#### San Francisco

My friends & I went to San Francisco last year because we all just needed a vacation. I would say it's one of those cities you go to when you truly want a break. Everyone is so friendly and welcoming and they have the best sushi & boba I have ever had located in their local china town marketplace. Two of my favorite childhood shows were filmed there **That's So Raven** and **Full House** and my favorite movie of all time **The Princess Diaries**. We visited the filming locations and it felt so odd becuase I grew up just watching these spots on tv as a child.


#### Seattle

I was only in Seattle for a day, but it was gorgeous and I defintely plan to make my way back there sometime soon.  

#### Chicago

Chicago is one of the most beautiful places I have been to. I feel like they have the best skyline ever! I was there last summer with my sister and cousin and we felt like we just had to do so much before we could leave. We went on an Architecture tour of the city, road electric bikes around Lincoln Park, and visited the house that one of my favorite current shows was filmed at **Shameless**.
