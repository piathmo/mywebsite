# Cities I Have Traveled To
I love to travel and be around a city/environment that is different than mine. Being from the Midwest, pretty much any other city is totally different. If we're going by coast, I would have to say I prefer the West Coast. There's way more scenery and a more peaceful feel to their cities. My favorite cities that I have been to would definitely have to be Vancouver, Los Angeles, South Padre Island, San Francisco, Seattle, and Chicago. I pretty much love any city with a pretty nature scene and cities with a nice skyline.

## Vancouver

I spent an entire summer in Vancouver when I was 15. It was my first time on a plane and I was traveling alone, but that's when I discovered my love for travel. I was nervous at first, but once I understood the all airports are pretty much the same in different *fonts*, I became extra comfortable. Vancouver not only had a beautiful city skyline, but their mountain scene blew me away.

## Los Angeles

I've been to Los Angeles (LA) a total of two times, and it was always fun! I love going to the beach and just being in the sun and enjoying the view. I feel like it is one of those places where everyone just minds their business and do what they have to do, which I love. In comparison to the Midwest, there is some sort of social standard that everyone has to meet in comparison to a big diverse city such as LA.

## South Padre Island

My friend and I went on a trip to South Padre, which is an island off of the Texas coast. We drove there, it was a 16 hour drive but it was defintely worth it. There was so much activties and things to do for the week we were there. We got matching ear piercings, parasailed (:satisfied:), went snorkeling, horseback riding, dolphin watching, and so much more.
