# Cities I Have Traveled To
I love to travel and be around a city/environment that is different than mine. Being from the Midwest, pretty much any other city is totally different. If we're going by coast, I would have to say I prefer the West Coast. There's way more scenery and a more peaceful feel to their cities. My favorite cities that I have been to would definitely have to be Vancouver, Los Angeles, South Padre Island, San Francisco, Seattle, and Chicago. I pretty much love any city with a pretty nature scene and cities with a nice skyline.

## Vancouver
I spent an entire summer in Vancouver when I was 15. It was my first time on a plane and I was traveling alone, but that's when I discovered my love for travel. I was nervous at first, but once I understood the all airports are pretty much the same in different *fonts*, I became extra comfortable. Vancouver not only had a beautiful city skyline, but their mountain scene blew me away.
