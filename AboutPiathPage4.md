## My Tech Experience
I am very new to the tech world (besides social media), but I feel like I am learning so much as I go. I feel like my favorite part of what we have learned so far in the course would have to be *Python*. I feel like I more comfortable because we had a couple modules using *Python*. I also like markdown because of how simple it was to learn. It's pretty basic and straight to the point which I really like.


#### Volume Calculator Challenge

 The Volume Calculator challenge interested me because we were essentially creating calculators! Figuring out the code got tricky with the loops, but I ended up figuring it out. I did run into a lot of syntax errors but it was a true definition of trial and error and then success.
            
print("Hello this is a volume calculator!")
choice=str(input("Please type the name of the shape you want to find the volume of"))

def vol_cube():
 edge=float(input("enter value of edge"))
 vol_cu = edge*edge*edge
 print("volume of cube is:")
 print(vol_cu)


def vol_cylinder():
 radius=input("enter radius")
 height=input("enter height")
 pi=3.14
 vol_cylinder=pi*int(radius)*int(radius)*int(height)
 print("volume of cylinder is")
 print(vol_cylinder)

def vol_cone():
 radius=float(input("Enter radius"))
 height=float(input("Enter height"))
 vol_cone=4/3*3.14*radius*radius*height
 print("volume of cone is:")
 print(vol_cone)

if choice == "cube":
 vol_cube()

elif choice == "cylinder":
 vol_cylinder()

elif choice == "cone":
 vol_cylinder()


   #### IOS App Development Class at Mizzou
I really love the idea of taking this class, but I also feel like I would need more inbetween classes before jumping into that. I love Apple products so being able to learn more about the developmental process would be very interesting to me. I like IT classes because it is literally the blueprint to what we see everyday on our phones and laptops.
