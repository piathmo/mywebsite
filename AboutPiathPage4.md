## My Tech Experience
I am very new to the tech world (besides social media), but I feel like I am learning so much as I go. I feel like my favorite part of what we have learned so far in the course would have to be *Python*. I feel like I more comfortable because we had a couple modules using *Python*. I also like markdown because of how simple it was to learn. It's pretty basic and straight to the point which I really like.

#### IOS App Development Class at Mizzou
I really love the idea of taking this class, but I also feel like I would need more inbetween classes before jumping into that. I love Apple products so being able to learn more about the developments  I like IT classes because it is literally the blueprint to what we see everyday on our phones and laptops.
